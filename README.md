## About
Currently only available for Android, however MAUI supports iOS, macOS and Windows so this could change

## Setup
The APK can be downloaded from https://github.com/atsamd21/Haveno-app/releases

or

Run the project from Visual Studio 2022 Community edition - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
The app can run either on a physical device with USB debugging and developer mode enabled or via the Android emulator

## Notes
There are two options for installing the Haveno daemon - you can technically switch after choosing but its not fully supported to switch from a local to remote node
1. Standalone, which installs Java 21 and the Haveno stagenet daemon on the device, this is a ~400mb download

2. Remote node: https://github.com/atsamd21/Haveno-remote-node. This requires Orbot with "Power user mode" enabled in settings. Or other TOR SOCKS5 proxy on port 9050. Orbot can be installed either via the Play Store or github as an APK: https://github.com/guardianproject/orbot-android/releases
